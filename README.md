### Project Oveview
* Business Use Case - Carparks occupancy data in NSW Carparks
* Data Source - Open Data
* Stream Data with Kafka Producer to the Broker and the Consumer will subscribe data
* Subscribed data is saved as Parquet format and used as training data to perform ML modelling (Linear Regression)
* The real time prediction is perform on live stream of data by the trained model and stream the prediction results
* The real-time data visualisation on car parks' occupancy and availability is also genertated
